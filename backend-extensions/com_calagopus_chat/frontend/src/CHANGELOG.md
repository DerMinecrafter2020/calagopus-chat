# Calagopus Chat changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-07
- Fixed internal Panel API requests by forwarding the connection and host metadata expected by the Panel router.
- Added an animated three-dot typing indicator while the AI prepares a direct-chat or `@AI` group reply.
- Improved server-tool error details to identify the failing Panel route without exposing server UUIDs.

## 0.1.10 — 2026-10-07
- Added a dedicated encrypted Panel user API key for AI server control. The key's per-server scopes and the requesting user's own server permissions are both required, and confirmations remain mandatory.
- Added AI-enabled group chats; the AI responds only when mentioned with `@AI`, and only the user who requested a pending power action can confirm it.

## 0.1.9 — 2026-10-07
- Added a standalone Chat page and an exclusive widget/page display setting; users get one active Chat view at a time.
- Added unread-count badges to both collapsed and expanded chat views.
- Made the floating chat window resizable on larger screens.
- Rendered AI Markdown emphasis and block quotes instead of showing raw formatting markers.
- Improved diagnostics when AI-provider or Panel-tool endpoints return invalid JSON.

## 0.1.8 — 2026-10-07
- Added optional AI server-list, live-status, and confirmed start/stop/restart tools, respecting each user's Panel permissions.
- Added administrator settings for which server tools are available; arbitrary console commands and file operations remain disabled.

## 0.1.7 — 2026-10-07
- Improved phone layouts with safe-area spacing, keyboard-aware chat sizing, and larger touch targets.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-10-06
- Added a confirmed option to remove a direct, group, or AI conversation from your chat list without deleting it for other participants.

## 0.1.5 — 2026-10-06
- Added provider-reported input and output token totals for AI requests made by Calagopus Chat.
- Added a dedicated Chat Settings page in the admin sidebar and an in-page changelog.

## 0.1.4
- Localized chat and AI settings UI through the Panel translation system, with English fallback strings.

## 0.1.3
- Added model discovery and a searchable model selector for supported AI providers.
- Added a per-user Enter-to-send preference; Shift+Enter inserts a newline.
